## Introduction

Thermoelectric Foodware (E2O). This project explores the design and development of an innovative food container that utilizes the Peltier effect to provide both heating and cooling capabilities, ensuring your food and beverages are always at the perfect temperature. Imagine having a cup that keeps your coffee hot or on a cold day or your smoothie refreshingly cool during a workout.  That's the vision behind E2O!

This project was initially developed as a Bachelor of Technology project in Mechanical Engineering, aiming to tackle the inefficiencies of traditional food storage and reduce food wastage. We hope to inspire further development and exploration in sustainable and efficient food storage solutions.

## Advantages

* Revolutionaries the Foodware by eliminating the inefficiencies of thermal insulated utensils currently present in the market.
* Internal heat generation and manipulation achieves the desired results without using bulky refrigeration system and high power consuming induction coils.
* App controlled IOT infrastructure enables to monitor and control over various settings of the product.
* Provides preferred food/drug temperature to the user at anytime and anywhere unlike the conventional storage which relies on thermal insulation.
* Accessibility and portability enables to carry it anywhere on the go.

## Application

* This product will monopolise and dominate the market due to its distinctive
* technology to acquire temperature modulation in storage container(Tiffin, Bottles, Electric Tiffin using induction coils)
* The modern alternative for the portable food/drug storage utensils.
* The internal heat generation and manipulation enables it use anytime without much heat loss to the environment.
